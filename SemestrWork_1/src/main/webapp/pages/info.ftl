Thanks to history, we get to know the data about the events that have occurred, predict the possible development of the future. History gives us the opportunity to learn from existing experience, and without studying history, it is impossible for people of different cultures to be tolerant of each other. National discord will grow among people who do not want to know history. </span>.
